                <p>
                    The second part of this Privacy Notice sets out in more detail, if applicable, in which context we
                    are processing your personal information and explains your rights and our obligations when doing so.

                <p>
                    1. On what basis do we use your personal information?

                <p>
                    We will not process your personal information if we do not have a proper justification foreseen in
                    the law for that purpose. Therefore, we will only process your personal information if we have
                    obtained your prior consent or, as permitted if the processing is necessary to comply with our legal
                    or regulatory obligations.

                        business or its assets
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Your personal information can also be accessed by or transferred to any national and/or
                    international regulatory, enforcement, public body or court, where we are required to do so by
                    applicable law or regulation or at their request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The personal information we collect from you may also be processed, accessed or stored in a country
                    outside the country where the Sponsor is located, which may not offer the same level of protection
                    of personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we transfer your personal information to external companies in other jurisdictions, we will make
                    sure to protect your personal information by (i) applying the level of protection required under the
                    local data protection/privacy laws applicable to the Sponsor, (ii) acting in accordance with our
                    policies and standards. You may request additional information in relation to international
                    transfers of personal information and obtain a copy of the adequate safeguard put in place by
                    exercising your rights as set out in Section 6 below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For intra-group transfers of personal information the Sponsor has adopted Binding Corporate Rules, a
                    system of principles, rules and tools, provided by European law, in an effort to ensure effective
                    levels of data protection relating to transfers of personal information outside the EEA and
                    Switzerland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. How do we protect your personal information?

                    We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to provide an adequate level
                    of security and confidentiality to your personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These measures take into account:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(i) the state of the art of the technology</li>

                    <li>(iv) the risk of the processing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The purpose thereof is to protect it against accidental or unlawful destruction or alteration,
                    accidental loss, unauthorized disclosure or access and against other unlawful forms of processing.
                </p>
